# Face-Recognition-in-Frequency-Domian

## Dataset
* olivetti_faces

## To Reproduce our Results
The simplest and the most comprehensive way is to launch the demonstration.ipynb in demonstration folder, where we evaluated all the discrimitive models and generative models. \
To re-train our baseline models, go to the olivetti_faces. \
To re-train our frequency domain models, go to the olivetti_faces_frequency_domain. \

## You need to download the Generator Weights from the Google Drive below \
